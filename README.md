# Crop_disease_and_yield_prediction
This project focuses on automated plant disease detection using deep learning models to assist farmers and researchers in identifying crop health conditions efficiently. The system utilizes TensorFlowâ€™s Inception model to classify whether a plant leaf is healthy or diseased based on image analysis.
